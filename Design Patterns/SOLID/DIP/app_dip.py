For example, say that your app is growing fast, and you want the app to be able to read data from a REST API. How would you do that?"""

"""You may think of adding a new method to BackEnd to retrieve the data from the REST API. However, that will also require you to modify FrontEnd, which should be closed to modification, according to the open-closed principle."""

"""To fix the issue, you can apply the dependency inversion principle and make your classes depend on abstractions rather than on concrete implementations like BackEnd. In this specific example, you can introduce a DataSource class that provides the interface to use in your concrete classes:"""

"""In this redesign of your classes, youâ€™ve added a DataSource class as an abstraction that provides the required interface, or the .get_data() method. Note how FrontEnd now depends on the interface provided by DataSource, which is an abstraction."""

"""Then you define the Database class, which is a concrete implementation for those cases where you want to retrieve the data from your database. This class depends on the DataSource abstraction through inheritance. Finally, you define the API class to support retrieving the data from the REST API. This class also depends on the DataSource abstraction."""

"""Here, you first initialize FrontEnd using a Database object and then again using an API object. Every time you call .display_data(), the result will depend on the concrete data source that you use. Note that you can also change the data source dynamically by reassigning the .data_source attribute in your FrontEnd instance."""
