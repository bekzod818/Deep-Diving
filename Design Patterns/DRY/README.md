# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

> The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
> within a system".

The DRY principle in coding stands for **"Don't Repeat Yourself."**

It means that in your code, you should avoid duplicating the same logic or information in multiple places. Instead, you
should create reusable functions, classes, or variables to keep your code concise and maintainable.

By following DRY, you make your code easier to understand, update, and debug. It also helps prevent errors that can
occur when you have multiple copies of the same code that need to be kept in sync.

In essence, DRY promotes efficiency and clarity in your code. Writing code once and using it many times is a smart
approach to software development!

## Benefits of DRY:

* Improved code maintainability: When code is not duplicated, it is easier to make changes and updates throughout the
  codebase.
* Reduced bugs: By eliminating code duplication, you reduce the risk of introducing bugs into your code.
* Increased code readability: DRY code is generally more readable and easier to understand, making it easier for other
  developers to maintain and work with your code.
* Improved code efficiency: By avoiding unnecessary code duplication, you can improve the efficiency of your code and
  make it run faster.

## Curly's Law - Do One Thing

Curly's Law is about choosing a single, clearly defined goal for any particular bit of code: Do One Thing.

Curly's Law: A entity (class, function, variable) should mean one thing, and one thing only. It should not mean one
thing in one circumstance and carry a different value from a different domain some other time. It should not mean two
things at once. It should mean One Thing and should mean it all of the time.
