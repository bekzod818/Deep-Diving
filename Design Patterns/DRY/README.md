# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

> The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

The DRY principle in coding stands for **"Don't Repeat Yourself."**

It means that in your code, you should avoid duplicating the same logic or information in multiple places. Instead, you should create reusable functions, classes, or variables to keep your code concise and maintainable.

By following DRY, you make your code easier to understand, update, and debug. It also helps prevent errors that can occur when you have multiple copies of the same code that need to be kept in sync.

In essence, DRY promotes efficiency and clarity in your code. Writing code once and using it many times is a smart approach to software development!

## Benefits of DRY:

* Improved code maintainability: When code is not duplicated, it is easier to make changes and updates throughout the codebase.
* Reduced bugs: By eliminating code duplication, you reduce the risk of introducing bugs into your code.
* Increased code readability: DRY code is generally more readable and easier to understand, making it easier for other developers to maintain and work with your code.
* Improved code efficiency: By avoiding unnecessary code duplication, you can improve the efficiency of your code and make it run faster.
