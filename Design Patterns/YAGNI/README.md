# You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) is an Extreme Programming (XP) practice which states: "Always implement things when you
actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."

Even if you're totally, totally, totally sure that you'll need a feature, later on, don't implement it now. Usually,
it'll turn out either:

* you don't need it after all, or
* what you actually need is quite different from what you foresaw needing earlier.

This doesn't mean you should avoid building flexibility into your code. It means you shouldn't overengineer something
based on what you think you might need later on.

There are two main reasons to practice YAGNI:

* Your code is better because you avoid polluting it with 'guesses' that turn out to be more or less wrong but stick
  around anyway.
