# Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore,
simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

Simple code has the following benefits:

* less time to write
* less chances of bugs
* easier to understand, debug and modify

Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

## Don't make me think

Code should be easy to read and understand without much thinking. If it isn't then there is a prospect of
simplification.
