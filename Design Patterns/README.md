### 1. SOLID Principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

### 3. Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

### 4. You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

### 5. Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil

Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their
programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are
considered.

> We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
> Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.
> - Donald Knuth

### 6. Boy-Scout Rule

Any time someone sees some code that isn't as clear as it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it right
there and then - or at least within a few minutes.

This opportunistic refactoring is referred to by Uncle Bob as following the boy-scout rule - always leave the code
behind in a better state than you found it.

The code quality tends to degrade with each change. This results in technical debt. The Boy-Scout Principle saves us
from that.

### 7. Code for the Maintainer

Code maintenance is an expensive and difficult process. Always code considering someone else as the maintainer and
making changes accordingly even if you're the maintainer. After a while, you'll remember the code as much as a stranger.

Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

### 8. Principle of Least Astonishment

Principle of Least Astonishment states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect
it to behave. The behavior should not astonish or surprise users.

Code should do what the name and comments suggest. Conventions should be followed. Surprising side effects should be
avoided as much as possible.
