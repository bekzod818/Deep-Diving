How does importing in Python work?

To answer this senior Python developer interview question, assume we have a directory called dir, inside which we have
a Python script. When you import a module in this Python script, the Python interpreter tries to find your imported module in this order:

1. It searches among other Python scripts inside the dir directory.
2. Then it goes over the list of the directories that are set using the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
3. Last, it searches through the default directories where Python files were installed. For example, 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\Lib'
